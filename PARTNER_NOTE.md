# For Tomorrow

Hey —

I've been thinking about how to structure this properly before it gets real.
Not because I don't trust you, but because deals fall apart over stuff that
never got written down, and I don't want that to happen to us.

Here's how I see it honestly:

---

## What you built
You built a lot of the WGH codebase. That's real and I'm not pretending
otherwise. The technical execution has been yours in a big way.

## What I built
I conceived JITTEr entirely — the Loki algorithm, the passport model,
the whole locked box concept — before we were working together.
That's documented with timestamps going back to January 2025.

On WGH I've been doing the product side — what it is, why Martha's Vineyard
first, how it scales, the rating system, the business model, the API
integrations, where it goes next. That's a different kind of work but
it's why the thing exists as a product and not just code.

## What I'm proposing

**One company. Both products inside it.**

65% me / 35% you. Four year vest, one year cliff for both of us.

I think that's honest given how we each contributed. You're not an
employee — 35% of something real is a life-changing number if we execute.

## The one thing I need

More than the percentage, I need final say on product decisions.

Not because I don't value your opinion — I do, and I'll always want it.
But I've seen what happens when two people are deadlocked and nothing
moves. Someone has to be the tiebreaker.

On product direction, features, partnerships, and what we build next —
that's me. On technical decisions and implementation — I'll always defer
to you. On anything that affects both of us significantly — we decide
together.

If we get an acquisition offer, neither of us can accept without the other.
That protects both of us.

## Why this works

You get meaningful equity in two products you helped build, with real
upside if this lands. I get to run the product the way I believe it needs
to be run. We both have skin in the game and a reason to keep building.

That's the deal I want to make with you. Let me know what you think.
