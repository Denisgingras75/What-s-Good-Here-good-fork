# Logo Creative Brief — What's Good Here

## The App

What's Good Here is a mobile-first food discovery app. Users rate individual dishes (not restaurants) on a 1-10 scale and vote "Would you order this again?" The app ranks dishes by crowd-sourced scores so you know exactly what to order before you sit down. Think of it as the friend who's already eaten everywhere and tells you what's actually worth getting.

Currently live on Martha's Vineyard, but the concept is location-agnostic and designed to expand.

## What We Need

One unified brand mark to replace two competing logos we've outgrown:
1. A fork-and-knife checkmark over a plate (generic, could be any food app)
2. A location pin with a Martha's Vineyard silhouette inside (too local, too abstract at small sizes)

We need a single mark that works as:
- App icon (iOS/Android home screen, 180x180px down to 60x60px)
- Favicon (16x16, 32x32)
- Splash screen hero (large, with wordmark below)
- In-app header (small, ~40px tall)
- Social share previews (og:image card)
- Dark background (primary usage) and light background (secondary)

## Brand Personality

**Opinionated & bold.** This app ranks things. It has a point of view. It doesn't hedge — it tells you the #1 dish at every restaurant. The logo should feel confident, not timid.

**Premium casual.** Elevated quality but zero pretension. Like a great restaurant that doesn't take itself too seriously. Not corporate, not cheap. Think craft cocktail bar, not chain restaurant.

**Word-of-mouth energy.** The app is built on people telling each other what's good. It's social, it's personal, it's opinionated. The core interaction is someone saying "you HAVE to try this."

**Not generic food app.** No fork-and-knife cliches, no plate silhouettes, no chef hats. Those signals say "restaurant review app" and we're not that — we rank dishes, not restaurants.

## What the Logo Should NOT Be

- A fork, knife, spoon, plate, or any standard food/restaurant iconography
- Anything tied to Martha's Vineyard (no island shape, lighthouse, ocean, etc.) — the brand needs to work anywhere
- Overly complex or detailed — must read clearly at 16px
- Cute or playful — this isn't a kids' app
- Cold or techy — this isn't a SaaS dashboard
- A question mark — signals uncertainty and weakness. The app has answers, not questions

## Color Palette

The app uses a dark theme called "Island Depths" as its default. The logo should work on dark backgrounds primarily, with a light-background variant.

| Color | Hex | Role |
|-------|-----|------|
| Deep Rust | `#C85A54` | Primary brand color, CTAs |
| Warm Gold | `#D9A765` | Secondary accent |
| Warm Orange | `#E07856` | Hover/accent |
| Deep Charcoal-Navy | `#0D1B22` | Dark background |
| Soft Cream | `#F5F1E8` | Light text on dark |

The mark could use Deep Rust as the primary color, or introduce a new color that complements this palette. Open to the designer's judgment.

There is also a light theme ("Appetite") with warm stone backgrounds (`#F0ECE8`) and orange-red primary (`#E8663C`). The logo needs to work on both.

## Typography

- **Brand font:** Sora (700/800 weight) — used for the "What's Good Here" wordmark
- **Body font:** DM Sans — used throughout the app

The wordmark text "What's Good Here" is set in Sora Bold. We're open to a custom logotype treatment, but Sora should remain the base.

## Deliverables

1. **Icon mark** — standalone symbol, no text. Must work at 16px (favicon) through 180px (app icon).
2. **Wordmark lockup** — icon + "What's Good Here" text, horizontal layout.
3. **Stacked lockup** — icon above text, for splash screens and centered layouts.
4. **File formats:** SVG (preferred for web), PNG at 1x/2x/3x for each variant.
5. **Color variants:** Full color on dark, full color on light, single-color (white), single-color (dark).

## Inspiration / Direction

Brands that hit a similar tone (for reference, not imitation):
- **Untappd** — bold, social, opinionated about beer ratings
- **Letterboxd** — premium feel for a community rating platform
- **The Infatuation** — confident food voice with personality
- **Allbirds** — premium casual, clean but warm

## Primary Concept: The Smashed Pin

The core idea: a location pin that has been SLAMMED down from above onto the exact spot. The point is visibly smashed/splayed from impact — like a stake driven into the ground. It didn't float there gently; it was dropped with conviction.

**What it communicates:** "We found it. Right here. Done." This isn't a suggestion — it's a declaration. The app doesn't wonder what's good, it tells you.

**Visual details to explore:**
- The pin tip should look flattened/splayed from the force of impact
- Subtle impact lines or a small crater/splash effect at the base
- The pin body stays bold and chunky — confident, heavy, authoritative
- The point is sharp and definitive — more arrow than teardrop
- "WGH" set in bold Sora underneath the mark

**The feeling:** A dart hitting a bullseye. A judge's gavel coming down. A finger stabbing at a map saying "THIS one."

**Scaling consideration:** At large sizes (splash screen), the impact detail can be dramatic. At small sizes (favicon), simplify to just the bold pin shape with a slightly flared tip — the attitude carries even without the full effect.

Other secondary concepts if the smashed pin doesn't land:
- A speech bubble or dialogue element (word-of-mouth discovery)
- A thumbs-up or approval gesture (the core voting action)
- A bold "WGH" monogram on its own
